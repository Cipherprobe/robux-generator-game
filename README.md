# Robux Generator Game

This is a solo scareware-themed game I made as a side project in like, 2 days lol. It's pretty short and quite simple, but I hope you'll enjoy it. I made this in solely in Python using tkinter as I wanted to test my Python experience. I mainly faced challenges with getting the sound effects to work as well as file writing, but I have learned from that experience. I hope to implement images to the game, develop compability for Mac, and expand to other browsers instead of just Chrome in the future.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer ⚠️
This is NOT a real Robux generator and is not affiliated, approved, or endorsed by Roblox in any way. This will NOT actually give you free Robux. There are also several actions that the game will perform involving your computer system; this is NOT a virus. This game is NOT compatible for Mac yet.

## 🔥 Important 🔥
The game will assume that you have Chrome installed on your computer in the DEFAULT installation location; it is hard-coded to open Chrome. If you don't have Chrome installed in its default location, the game will break!

## 🥶 Dependencies 🥶
- Python 3.11+
- Google Chrome

## 🥁 Running the Game 🥁
After installing Python, Chrome, and the repo files, run the .bat file (Windows)
### I'm working on developing compability for Mac, might take a while with my skills though 😅
