# Robux Generator Game

This is a solo scareware-themed game I made as a side project in like, 2 days lol. It's pretty short and quite simple, but I hope you'll enjoy it. I made this in solely in Python using tkinter as I wanted to test my Python experience. I mainly faced challenges with getting the sound effects to work as well as file writing, but I have learned from that experience. I hope to implement images to the game as well as develop compability for Mac in the future.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer ⚠️
This is NOT a real Robux generator and is not affiliated, approved, or endorsed by Roblox in any way. This will NOT actually give you free Robux. There are also several actions that the game will perform involving your computer system; this is NOT a virus. This game is NOT compatible for Mac yet.

## 🥶 Dependencies 🥶
- Python 3.11+

## 🥁 Running the Game 🥁
After installing Python, simply run the .bat file (Windows)
### I'm working on developing compability for Mac, might take a while with my skills though 😅
